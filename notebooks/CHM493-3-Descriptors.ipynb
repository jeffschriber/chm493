    "If we want to train a model to predict some property--say, solubility--we need a way for our program to uniquely identify a molecule. One of the more common tools is called the SMILES string (simplified molecular-input line-entry system), which translates a chemical line drawing into a computer-readible string. SMILES strings were invented before the days of ChemDraw, but they've maintained relevance in chemoinformatics. In this notebook assignment, you will learn how to write, read and translate SMILES strings."
